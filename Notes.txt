Using black keys makes the music less predictable subconsciously
If there is a whole setp at the end, use a half step to improve resolution from 7 to 8
You can play it with more velocity to force resolution
Avoid the 4th note in a melody, it usually doesnt sound good
7th note in a melody should resolve to 1 if semitone away

Key C and Key B are the most predictable key signatures


Add Blues
Fix Sharps/Flats

Cannot play ionian and lydian on top of each other
